# CoreML

Some experiments I did when I worked in PRORES AS - not part of any project. Algorithms were developed with Politecnico di Milano during Master's there. 

In PRORES AS, I developed an Image-driven Machine Learning for prediction of petrophysical properties from core photographs. The result was very satisfactory. Then, I extend this work for prediction in Thin Section and CT scans only for my curiosity. Data used are public from Kansas Geological Survey (KGS) and Volve field.
